1. Write a function that takes a number and gives me the nth
number in the fibonacci sequence
// DONE, I think
// Refactor

2. Create an input field
// Do first in the terminal
// Then place on the html page & get into main

3. Create a button that generates the number and puts in on
the screen

Extra Credit
- This font is lame, use Roboto for me
// CSS
- Give the input field a rounded border
// Bootstrap?
- Add input validation that only allows the button to be pressed 
when only numbers are in the input
// After validating this, I can make it only whole numbers
